            <h2 class="text-center">COVID Testing Priortization</h2>

            <p>The intent of this page is to showcase results and document the methodology used
               for first pass of doing COVID testing prioritization.  This work is done independently.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-center">Assumptions About Testing</h2>
            <p>
            Before discussing the mathematics behind how a prioritization may be considered, here is a proposed logic
            for instituting testing.  The point of testing, from an epidemiological perspective is to understand the           extent of and outbreak and understand what the potential infection rate may be. However, inherent in any
            testing scheme, the fact remains that this is pulled from a sample.  At best the samples have been collected from a representative group such that all of the error occurs just from the random sampling.  However in the case of COVID there is potential for bias as only people who feel unwell or who have been in close proximity to someone who is exposed.  However, we don't yet have enough information on what the sources of the bias are so the metrics for the moment are only ones that reflect sampling error.  Considering this motivation the initial thoughts around prioritization are to start with a base of where is there the most uncertainty around infection rates along with contexts around those areas that help define whether an area is underserved.  At present the map below is just a first pass to help understand the base infection rates, plus the uncertainty around this information
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-center">Calculating uncertainty </h2>

            <p>
            The conventional way statisticians calculate uncertainty is by use of a 'confidence interval' which makes allows us to generate intervals that are likely to contain the true infection rate at a given point in time.  However, the traditional approach for confidence intervals can be ammended here because we have good apriori information about what the approximate population of people in the various zip codes is.  Because of this, we can use a concept called a finite population correction in order to calculate these intervals.

                <p>
 In this term one can see that we are correcting for the fact that we know the population size.  Therefore as the number of people tested gets closer to the population we have more certainty.
